 Huggingface_basics  Hugging Face AI Bootcamp  
Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, and Spacesâ€”working through full-stack ML pipelines, model fineâ€‘tuning, and AI application deployment on Gradio.   


 LLM Models Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically categorized into two major types:

1.Text-Based Models

Users provide a text prompt, and the model generates text output in response.

Example: GPT-2 generating sentences from an input prompt.

2.Multimodal Models (State-of-the-Art)

These models handle multiple types of input and output (text, image, audio, video).

Example use cases:

Text-to-Image: Generate an image from a text description.

Text-to-Audio: Convert text into spoken voice.

Text-to-Video: Create short clips from prompts.

 Hugging Face Platform
Hugging Face provides a collaborative platform for hosting models, datasets, and machine learning demos.

It enables seamless integration with popular tools like Transformers, Datasets, Diffusers, and Gradio for production-ready AI workflows.

We will be using Google Colab for hands-on implementation:

ðŸ”¹ Open Google Colab
ðŸ”¹ Connect to GPU runtime (Runtime â†’ Change runtime type â†’ GPU)

 Proof of Concepts (PoC)

PoC 1 â€“ Text Generation with GPT-2
Tools: transformers (by Hugging Face)
Model: gpt2
Task: Generate coherent text given an initial input prompt.

PoC 2 â€“ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Tools: transformers + pretrained NER models
Task: Identify and label entities like names, locations, organizations, etc., in a given sentence.

 Mini Projects
 Project 1 â€“ Sentiment Analysis App using Gradio
Analyze whether input text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Built a Gradio web interface to accept input and show results interactively.

 Project 2 â€“ Text-to-Image Generation
Used a multimodal model (e.g., from the diffusers library) to generate images from descriptive text.

Example prompt: "A serene lake under a starry sky with glowing mountains."
